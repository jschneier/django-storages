Alibaba OSS
=============

Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service is compatible with the S3 protocol. To use it follow the instructions in the :doc:`Amazon S3 docs <amazon-S3>` with the important caveats that you must:

- Set ``AWS_S3_ADDRESSING_STYLE`` to ``virtual`` (For security reasons, OSS supports only virtual hosted style access)
- Set ``AWS_S3_REGION_NAME`` to your OSS region (such as ``oss-cn-shanghai`` or ``oss-cn-hangzhou``)
- Set ``AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL`` to the value of ``https://${AWS_S3_REGION_NAME}.aliyuncs.com``
- Set the values of ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` to the corresponding values from OSS

Notes
*****

  Be aware Alibaba OSS are not fully compatible so there are some difference between them.
