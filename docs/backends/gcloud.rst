Google Cloud Storage
====================

This backend provides Django File API for `Google Cloud Storage <https://cloud.google.com/storage/>`_
using the Python library provided by Google.


Installation
------------

Use pip to install from PyPI::

    pip install django-storages[google]

Authentication
--------------
By default, this library will try to use the credentials associated with the
current Google Cloud infrastrcture/environment for authentication.

In most cases, the default service accounts are not sufficient to read/write and sign files in GCS, you so you will need to create a dedicated service account:

1. Create a service account. (`Google Getting Started Guide <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started>`__)

2. Make sure your service account has access to the bucket and appropriate permissions. (`Using IAM Permissions <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions>`__)

3. Ensure this service account is associated to the type of compute being used (Google Compute Engine (GCE), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Google Cloud Run (GCR), etc)

For development use cases, or other instances outside Google infrastructure:

4. Create the key and download `your-project-XXXXX.json` file.

5. Ensure the key is mounted/available to your running Django app.

6. Set an environment variable of GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the path of the json file.

Alternatively, you can use the setting `GS_CREDENTIALS` as described below.


Getting Started
---------------
Set the default storage and bucket name in your settings.py file:

::

    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage'
    GS_BUCKET_NAME = 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME_GOES_HERE'

To allow ``django-admin`` collectstatic to automatically put your static files in your bucket set the following in your settings.py::

    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage'

Once you're done, default_storage will be Google Cloud Storage::

    >>> from django.core.files.storage import default_storage
    >>> print default_storage.__class__
    <class 'storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage'>

This way, if you define a new FileField, it will use the Google Cloud Storage::

    >>> from django.db import models
    >>> class Resume(models.Model):
    ...     pdf = models.FileField(upload_to='pdfs')
    ...     photos = models.ImageField(upload_to='photos')
    ...
    >>> resume = Resume()
    >>> print resume.pdf.storage
    <storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage object at ...>

Settings
--------

To use gcloud set::

    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage'

``GS_BUCKET_NAME``

Your Google Storage bucket name, as a string. Required.

``GS_PROJECT_ID`` (optional)

Your Google Cloud project ID. If unset, falls back to the default
inferred from the environment.

``GS_CREDENTIALS`` (optional)

The OAuth 2 credentials to use for the connection. If unset, falls
back to the default inferred from the environment
(i.e. GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS)

::

    from google.oauth2 import service_account

    GS_CREDENTIALS = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
        "path/to/credentials.json"
    )

``GS_DEFAULT_ACL`` (optional, default is None)

ACL used when creating a new blob, from the
`list of predefined ACLs <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists#predefined-acl>`_.
(A "JSON API" ACL is preferred but an "XML API/gsutil" ACL will be
translated.)

For most cases, the blob will need to be set to the ``publicRead`` ACL in order for the file to be viewed.
If GS_DEFAULT_ACL is not set, the blob will have the default permissions set by the bucket.

``publicRead`` files will return a public, non-expiring url. All other files return
a signed (expiring) url.

.. note::
   GS_DEFAULT_ACL must be set to 'publicRead' to return a public url. Even if you set
   the bucket to public or set the file permissions directly in GCS to public.

.. note::
    When using this setting, make sure you have ``fine-grained`` access control enabled on your bucket,
    as opposed to ``Uniform`` access control, or else, file  uploads will return with HTTP 400. If you
    already have a bucket with ``Uniform`` access control set to public read, please keep 
    ``GS_DEFAULT_ACL`` to ``None`` and set ``GS_QUERYSTRING_AUTH`` to ``False``.

``GS_QUERYSTRING_AUTH`` (optional, default is True)

If set to ``False`` it forces the url not to be signed. This setting is useful if you need to have a
bucket configured with ``Uniform`` access control configured with public read. In that case you should
force the flag ``GS_QUERYSTRING_AUTH = False`` and ``GS_DEFAULT_ACL = None``

``GS_FILE_CHARSET`` (optional)

Allows overriding the character set used in filenames.

``GS_FILE_OVERWRITE`` (optional: default is ``True``)

By default files with the same name will overwrite each other. Set this to ``False`` to have extra characters appended.

``GS_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`` (optional)

The maximum amount of memory a returned file can take up (in bytes) before being
rolled over into a temporary file on disk. Default is 0: Do not roll over.

``GS_BLOB_CHUNK_SIZE`` (optional: default is ``None``)

The size of blob chunks that are sent via resumable upload. If this is not set then the generated request
must fit in memory. Recommended if you are going to be uploading large files.

.. note::

   This must be a multiple of 256K (1024 * 256)

``GS_CACHE_CONTROL`` (optional: default is ``None``)

Sets Cache-Control HTTP header for the file, more about HTTP caching can be found `here <https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching#cache-control>`_

``GS_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT`` (optional: default is ``None``)

Sets a `custom endpoint <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints>`_,
that will be used instead of ``https://storage.googleapis.com`` when generating URLs for files.

``GS_LOCATION`` (optional: default is ``''``)

Subdirectory in which the files will be stored.
Defaults to the root of the bucket.

``GS_EXPIRATION`` (optional: default is ``timedelta(seconds=86400)``)

The time that a generated URL is valid before expiration. The default is 1 day.
Public files will return a url that does not expire. Files will be signed by
the credentials provided to django-storages (See GS_CREDENTIALS).

Note: Default Google Compute Engine (GCE) Service accounts are
`unable to sign urls <https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-python/latest/storage/blobs.html#google.cloud.storage.blob.Blob.generate_signed_url>`_.

The ``GS_EXPIRATION`` value is handled by the underlying `Google library  <https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-python/latest/storage/blobs.html#google.cloud.storage.blob.Blob.generate_signed_url>`_.
It supports `timedelta`, `datetime`, or `integer` seconds since epoch time.


Usage
-----

Fields
^^^^^^

Once you're done, default_storage will be Google Cloud Storage::

    >>> from django.core.files.storage import default_storage
    >>> print default_storage.__class__
    <class 'storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage'>

This way, if you define a new FileField, it will use the Google Cloud Storage::

    >>> from django.db import models
    >>> class Resume(models.Model):
    ...     pdf = models.FileField(upload_to='pdfs')
    ...     photos = models.ImageField(upload_to='photos')
    ...
    >>> resume = Resume()
    >>> print resume.pdf.storage
    <storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage object at ...>

Storage
^^^^^^^

Standard file access options are available, and work as expected::

    >>> default_storage.exists('storage_test')
    False
    >>> file = default_storage.open('storage_test', 'w')
    >>> file.write('storage contents')
    >>> file.close()

    >>> default_storage.exists('storage_test')
    True
    >>> file = default_storage.open('storage_test', 'r')
    >>> file.read()
    'storage contents'
    >>> file.close()

    >>> default_storage.delete('storage_test')
    >>> default_storage.exists('storage_test')
    False

Model
^^^^^

An object without a file has limited functionality::

    >>> obj1 = Resume()
    >>> obj1.pdf
    <FieldFile: None>
    >>> obj1.pdf.size
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: The 'pdf' attribute has no file associated with it.

Saving a file enables full functionality::

    >>> obj1.pdf.save('django_test.txt', ContentFile('content'))
    >>> obj1.pdf
    <FieldFile: tests/django_test.txt>
    >>> obj1.pdf.size
    7
    >>> obj1.pdf.read()
    'content'

Files can be read in a little at a time, if necessary::

    >>> obj1.pdf.open()
    >>> obj1.pdf.read(3)
    'con'
    >>> obj1.pdf.read()
    'tent'
    >>> '-'.join(obj1.pdf.chunks(chunk_size=2))
    'co-nt-en-t'

Save another file with the same name::

    >>> obj2 = Resume()
    >>> obj2.pdf.save('django_test.txt', ContentFile('more content'))
    >>> obj2.pdf
    <FieldFile: tests/django_test_.txt>
    >>> obj2.pdf.size
    12

Push the objects into the cache to make sure they pickle properly::

    >>> cache.set('obj1', obj1)
    >>> cache.set('obj2', obj2)
    >>> cache.get('obj2').pdf
    <FieldFile: tests/django_test_.txt>
