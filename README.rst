Installation
============
Installing from PyPI is as easy as doing:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install django-storages

If you'd prefer to install from source (maybe there is a bugfix in master that
hasn't been released yet) then the magic incantation you are looking for is:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -e 'git+https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages.git#egg=django-storages'

Once that is done set ``DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE`` to the backend of your choice.
If, for example, you want to use the boto3 backend you would set:

.. code-block:: python

  DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage'


If you are using the ``FileSystemStorage`` as your storage management class in your models ``FileField`` fields, remove them
and don't specify any storage parameter. That way, the ``DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE`` class will be used by default in your field.
For example, if you have a `photo` field defined as:

.. code-block:: python

    photo = models.FileField(
        storage=FileSystemStorage(location=settings.MEDIA_ROOT),
        upload_to='photos',
    )

Set it to just:

.. code-block:: python

    photo = models.FileField(
        upload_to='photos',
    )

There are also a number of settings available to control how each storage backend functions,
please consult the documentation for a comprehensive list.

About

History
=======
This repo began as a fork of the original library under the package name of django-storages-redux and
became the official successor (releasing under django-storages on PyPI) in February of 2016.

Found a Bug? Something Unsupported?
===================================
I suspect that a few of the storage engines in backends/ have been unsupported
for quite a long time. I personally only really need the S3Storage backend but
welcome bug reports (and especially) patches and tests for some of the other
backends.
