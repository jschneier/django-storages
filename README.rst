Installation
============
Installing from PyPI is as easy as doing:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install django-storages

If you'd prefer to install from source (maybe there is a bugfix in master that
hasn't been released yet) then the magic incantation you are looking for is:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -e 'git+https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages.git#egg=django-storages'

For detailed instructions on how to configure the backend of your choice please consult the documentation.
